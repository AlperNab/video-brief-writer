## 🧭 What This Project Does

**Video Brief Writer** is a standalone, browser-based AI workflow app for **Creator / Video Strategy**. It turns structured inputs, uploaded files, and project-specific settings into reviewable outputs using a deterministic local engine plus optional local/cloud LLM enhancement.

**Core job:** Topic/URL → video production brief.

**Designed for:** Domain operator, business owner, analyst, or team member who needs this workflow executed reliably.

**Why use it:**

- 🧩 **Standalone project folder:** run this project by itself without depending on a central dashboard.
- 🖥️ **Elegant GUI:** includes project-specific panels, structured forms, upload handling, output preview, and exports.
- 🧠 **Model-flexible:** choose local models for privacy or cloud models for stronger reasoning.
- 🧾 **Auditable:** every run is stored in SQLite with inputs, settings, result, and export history.
- 🚫 **No fake live data:** external systems are only used when real API keys/connectors are configured.
- 🛡️ **Human review gates:** sensitive legal, medical, hiring, finance, or security outputs are flagged for review.

## 📤 Outputs & Exports

- video brief
- script outline
- shot list
- titles
- repurposing pack

The export system is designed for reviewable deliverables. For regulated or business-critical work, export drafts should be reviewed before sending to clients, customers, patients, employees, authorities, or production systems.

---

## 🔌 Real Integrations & Connector Policy

Configured integrations in this standalone folder:

- File upload
- REST API
- Export download
- Job history
- Trend/URL fetch optional

### Real Connector Requirements

- real audio/video/asset files
- transcription/vision provider for media analysis where needed
- brand guidelines and publishing platform requirements
- brand voice guide
- ad platform or analytics connector for live performance data
- claims/compliance review before publishing

**Important:** this project does not simulate live data. If a workflow needs live Shopify, ATS, ERP, tax, customs, medical, security, market, map, analytics, or repository data, it must be connected with valid credentials and real API access. Missing connectors should produce clear setup errors rather than invented results.

---

## 🧯 Guardrails

- Show uncertainty and confidence
- Cite evidence from input when possible
- Human review required for legal, medical, financial, hiring, or security decisions
- Do not invent facts absent from input

Recommended operating rules:

- ✅ Use local models for private or sensitive files.
- ✅ Keep API keys out of Git.
- ✅ Review low-confidence or high-impact outputs manually.
- ✅ Keep source files and exported deliverables organized under `data/`.
- ❌ Do not treat AI output as legal, medical, tax, hiring, trading, or security authority without expert review.

---

## 🧪 Testing

Run the local smoke test:

```bash
python tests/test_single_project.py
```

Run a health check after starting the server:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:9163/api/health
```

Expected result: the API returns `ok: true` and identifies this project.

## 🚢 Deployment Notes

For local/private deployment, run with `uvicorn` behind a reverse proxy if needed. For production:

- Set `AI_SUITE_SECRET_KEY`.
- Use HTTPS.
- Store provider keys in environment variables or a proper secret manager.
- Restrict upload sizes and allowed file types.
- Back up the SQLite database or move job storage to a managed database.
- Add authentication before exposing beyond localhost.
- Enable logging and monitoring.

Example production-style command:

```bash
AI_SUITE_HOST=0.0.0.0 AI_SUITE_PORT=9163 uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 9163
```

---

## 🧯 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| `python` not found | Install Python 3.10+ and ensure it is on PATH. |
| PowerShell blocks the script | Run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass`. |
| Port already in use | Set another port: `AI_SUITE_PORT=9200 ./run_gui.sh`. |
| Provider fails | Verify API key, base URL, selected model, and account quota. |
| Local model fails | Start Ollama/LM Studio/vLLM before running the workflow. |
| PDF/DOCX export fails | Reinstall requirements and confirm optional export dependencies installed. |
| Upload extraction is incomplete | Use cleaner source files or paste the important text into `work_brief`. |

---
